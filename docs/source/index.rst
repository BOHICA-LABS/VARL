Vulnerability Assessment Reporting language (VARL)
==================================================

Introduction
------------

The Vulnerability Assessment Reporting language (VARL) is a structured format for reporting the results of a
vulnerability assessment.

The language includes:

* A clear and concise summary of the assessment's findings, including the number of vulnerabilities identified and their
  severity.

* A detailed list of all vulnerabilities identified, including their names, severity levels, and descriptions.

* Recommendations for mitigating or eliminating the vulnerabilities, along with a prioritization of the actions that
  should be taken first.

* The scope of the assessment, including the systems and applications that were tested and the time period during which
  the assessment was conducted.

* The methodology used for the assessment, including the tools and techniques employed.

* The names and qualifications of the individuals who conducted the assessment.

* The format of the report should is machine-readable

* Appendices, if any, containing detailed information about specific vulnerabilities or systems, along with any
  supporting documentation or evidence.

* The format is intended to provide a clear, actionable report that can be easily understood by both technical and
  non-technical stakeholders.


VARL Schema Definition
----------------------

A Vulnerability Assessment Reporting Language (VARL) schema current includes the following fields:

* Report Date: The date on which the assessment was conducted.

* Assessment Scope: The systems and applications that were tested during the assessment, including their IP addresses
  and hostnames.

* Assessment Methodology: The tools and techniques used to conduct the assessment, including any manual methods or
  automated tools.

* Vulnerabilities: An array of vulnerabilities identified during the assessment, including their names, severities, and
  descriptions.

* Recommendations: An array of recommendations for mitigating or eliminating the vulnerabilities, along with a
  prioritization of the actions that should be taken first.

* Assessment Team: An array of the names and qualifications of the individuals who conducted the assessment.

* Report Summary: A clear and concise summary of the assessment's findings, including the number of vulnerabilities
  identified and their severity.

* Report Evidence: An array of appendices, if any, containing detailed information about specific vulnerabilities or
  systems, along with any supporting documentation or evidence.

Benefits of VARL
----------------

The benefits of using the Vulnerability Assessment and Reporting Language (VARL) are as follows:

* Improved security: A VARL helps to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, which allows organizations to take
  proactive measures to mitigate them and improve overall security.

* Standardization: VARL helps to standardize the reporting of vulnerabilities across different teams, organizations, and
  industries, making it easier to communicate and compare the results of assessments.

* Ease of use: VARL simplifies the process of reporting vulnerabilities by providing a clear and consistent format for
  organizing information.

* Better collaboration: VARL makes it easier for different teams, such as security teams, developers, and management,
  to collaborate and work together to address vulnerabilities.

* Increased efficiency: VARL streamlines the vulnerability assessment and reporting process, reducing the time and
  resources required to complete assessments.

* Improved tracking: VARL provides a standardized way to track the status of vulnerabilities and their resolution,
  making it easier to ensure that they are addressed in a timely manner.

* Better decision-making: By providing a clear and organized view of vulnerabilities and their impact, VARL enables
  better decision-making, allowing organizations to prioritize their remediation efforts based on risk.
